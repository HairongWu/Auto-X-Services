# Auto-X Services

## Getting Started :rocket:
1. **Open your editor**

2. **Open the Terminal** - Typically, you can do this from a 'Terminal' tab or by using a shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).

3. **Clone the Repository and Navigate into the Directory** - Once your terminal is open, you can clone the repository and move into the directory by running the commands below.

   **For Mac/Linux users** :apple: :penguin:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HairongWu/Auto-X-Services.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   **For Windows users** :windows:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HairongWu/Auto-X-Services.git
   cd AgentGPT
   ./setup.bat
   ```
4. **Follow the setup instructions from the script** - add the appropriate API keys, and once all of the services are running, travel to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web-browser.
